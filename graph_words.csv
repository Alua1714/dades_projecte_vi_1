24902,2316735,George Mason University,VA,2023-08-01,2026-07-31,collaborative research using a weather model and geologic data to test tectonic mechanisms in an intercontinental setting the altai mountains of central asia,the height and shape of mountain ranges exert a profound influence on the world around us mountains host a variety of ecological habitats provide much of the water and nutrients necessary for life the critical minerals needed for society and influence climate and weather patterns the size and shape of mountains reflect the underlying solid earth processes responsible for how the crust deforms for earthquakes and for related natural hazards despite their importance it remains exceptionally difficult to recover the history of mountains including how changes in their height and shape interact with the atmosphere to drive climate and weather this project seeks to apply new advances in the atmospheric and geosciences to a natural experiment in central asia where the height and shape of the altai mountains over the past million years are thought to have precipitated a major change in atmospheric circulation and in climate the altai are one of the major ranges in asia that substantially modify regional climate and ecosystems and spawn some of the largest intracontinental earthquakes ever recorded this research will use a novel weather model to predict changes in atmospheric circulation and climate in response to the size height and growth history of the altai these model predictions will be measured against field and laboratory data gleaned from the sediments shed from the altai using rock magnetic data preserved in the sediments and the steepness of river channels carved into the mountains the principal investigators will be able to construct an age model consistent with the onset and growth history of the altai range this interdisciplinary approach will be pursued by a multi university team in the u s that includes early career professors graduate students and undergraduates in collaboration with mongolian colleagues at the institute for astronomy and geophysics the project will train three phd students three early career scientists and one undergraduate in inter disciplinary geosciences and build international exchange opportunities the results of this research will improve understanding of the coupling among solid earth and atmospheric processes and contribute to addressing societal challenges such as building resistance to environmental change and to earthquake related natural hazards mountain topography reflects complex couplings among tectonic dynamic and surficial processes and influences climatic evolution marine and terrestrial biogeochemistry and even the development of biodiversity unfortunately the climatic proxies which are so often used to reconstruct past topography are themselves dependent upon a variety of other factors consequently constraining the tectonic and or dynamic processes that are responsible for the height of mountains remains exceptionally difficult this project will leverage novel advances in the atmospheric sciences to understand topographic growth beyond the simple upslope model of orographic rainout the project focuses on the altai mountains of northern central asia a poorly understood cenozoic rejuvenation of the central asia orogenic belt that rises more than kilometers casts a substantial rain shadow and is associated with some of the largest intracontinental earthquakes on record altai uplift has been variously attributed to far field stress propagation from the collision of india and eurasia or to dynamic support from a mantle plume a subducting slab or lithospheric delamination each of these uplift mechanisms predict a unique spatial and temporal pattern of rock uplift and of regional climate change based upon how and when these uplift mechanisms modified the height shape and orientation of the altai existing data are contradictory sedimentary geomorphic and thermochronologic data indicate that tectonic uplift began in the paleogene whereas paleoclimate data from both windward and leeward basins suggest no clear climatic change until the late miocene when there appears to be substantial aridification in western mongolia the project focuses on collecting new spatially resolved rock uplift data using inversions of fluvial topography and new stable and clumped isotope records of paleoclimate from leeside basins the age model for both rock uplift and of climatic change across western mongolia will be constrained by magneto and cyclostratigraphic based age models of adjacent syn deformational basin sediments the weather research and forecasting model will be used to predict the climate impact of distinct altai topographic histories combined these data sets permit tests of the theories that seek to explain cenozoic altai uplift this award reflects nsf s statutory mission and has been deemed

social work environments,stress has been identified as the health epidemic of the st century and office related work is a significant driver of stress among americans due to long hours rapid deadlines heavy workload and job insecurity yet office workers are often entirely unaware of the impact of stress until they notice symptoms of declining physical or mental health or well being such as musculoskeletal discomfort headaches poor sleep or lack of motivation even more problematic most individuals do not know how their work activities and the physical and social work environments are related to stress and other health outcomes while stress is almost always treated as unfavorable stress can be positive opportunities exist to better understand how to promote eustress that is energizing and essential for productivity and minimize distress that leads to negative emotions disturbed bodily states strain and burnout thus this project aims to generate new analytic models to

molecules in a liquid or vapor stream lies at the heart of most industrial chemical processes traditional separations which boil and condense liquids to separate them are energy intensive polymer membranes are increasingly used to perform these separations more efficiently membranes also find increasing applications in producing drinkable water from brackish or sea water as well as in fuel cells and chemical batteries which will play an important role in an energy future powered by wind and solar polymer membranes separate molecules by size and by affinity small pores allow small molecules to pass but block large molecules membranes decorated with charges can encourage or discourage the passage of charged or polar molecules evidently there are tradeoffs in membrane design bigger pores allow molecules to pass easily but degrade the ability of the membrane to discriminate between different molecules membrane design has proceeded slowly by trial and error an atomic scale view of membrane structure and how it affects the entry and passage of different molecules would enable better designs experimental probes of membranes on the atomic scale are vital but limited an alternative approach is to use molecular simulations in which movies are made of the molecules in a small region of a membrane simulations can in principle show how molecules pass through a membrane and allow us to measure the affinity of the membrane for different species but for these movies to accurately represent real molecular motion multiple challenges must be met realistic molecular arrangements of membranes must be constructed forces between atoms must be realistic particularly for strongly interacting charged species simulations must cover enough time that molecules explore the membrane special techniques must be developed to encourage molecules normally repelled by the membrane to enter so that rejection efficiency can be measured simulations in which one species is pulled through the membrane must be performed to measure the resistance experienced by molecules as they move this project aims to meet all these challenges and thereby enable simulations to assess the performance of membranes of different structures and compositions which will help design better membranes for myriad applications in a sustainable future the principal investigator pi for this project emphasizes broader impacts in undergraduate and graduate education including extensive online simulation tutorials a newly developed course in writing and presenting for scientists and engineers and a recently written book based on the course which is unique in its teaching of writing and presenting together in the broader context of the scientific enterprise technical summary aqueous membranes for reverse osmosis ion exchange membranes for chemical flow batteries and nanofiltration membranes for lithium recovery all face the common design challenge of readily transporting some species while strongly rejecting others this inevitably involves tradeoffs bigger pores improve transport but decrease selectivity and stronger species binding promotes selectivity but impedes transport transport depends on the pore space geometry membrane flexibility and species binding to membrane moieties ion selectivity can be manipulated in several ways including high concentrations of bound ions that attract counterions and repel like charge ions narrow pores too small for ions to be well solvated and favorable interactions with bound polar species because membrane permeability and ion selectivity both depend on angstrom scale structure and kinetics atomistic simulations have the potential to advance understanding and aid design of aqueous membranes for reverse osmosis chemical flow batteries and ion recovery this project develops and exploits new approaches to unlock this potential by addressing key challenges in membrane simulations validated ion potentials so that mobile ions stick properly to bound ions fast atomistic simulations to thoroughly equilibrate membrane structures transfer free energies which quantify how well a membrane excludes ions full transport measurements to predict all fluxes in response to any gradients atomistic simulations are well suited to explore transport and selectivity providing unique insight to complement experimental results if the key challenges listed above are met simulations can also help the membrane science community to revise and refine conflicting traditional models of transport free volume mediated diffusion versus percolative flow and selectivity donnan exclusion versus size exclusion which have persisted for decades polymer membranes are essential elements for sustainable technologies including reverse osmosis to supply fresh water chemical flow batteries to store wind and solar energy and nanofiltration to recover lithium for electric vehicles membrane based separations are much more energy efficient than traditional alternatives based on phase transitions the pi s research program emphasizes broader impacts in university education including an extensive set of simulation tutorials online to which new techniques developed under this project will be added a recently developed credit course in writing and presenting for scientists and engineers and a recently book based on my course which is unique

landlab,research in the s revealed that earth s outer shell is broken into a dozen or so relatively rigid plates that represent the top of a convecting system in earth s deep interior motions between and within these tectonic plates create mountain ranges volcanoes sedimentary basins and other major geologic surface features these features represent vertical relief that under the force of gravity is then subject to erosion landsliding and other forms of downslope movement of mass earth s topography is thus controlled by the balance between tectonic processes that build relief and erosional processes that remove and redistribute relief conversely the evolution of topography affects the forces within tectonic plates influencing subsequent faulting and volcanic activity and leading to feedbacks over a range of spatial and temporal scales on million year timescales sedimentary basins create natural resource deposits such as oil and gas reservoirs and chemical reactions associated with erosion can remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere directly influencing earth s climate and habitability on human timescales the creation of vertical relief promotes landsliding and far reaching sediment distribution which is often associated with interacting geohazards including earthquakes tsunamis and volcanic eruptions building on prior previously independent work modeling earth s interior and surface processes separately this project develops new computational methods to simulate and advance our knowledge of the dynamic interplay between earth s surface and interior and makes these methods available to the scientific community the computational methods derived through this project have direct societal relevance to studying geohazards and resource exploration all software developed through this award follows established software engineering practices is openly available to the public and is fully documented community training activities are used to engage other scientists and promote the adoption of the new methods developed by this project a major research challenge in the geosciences is understanding how the earth s surface and its interior interact to shape one another because much of the relevant interactions are inaccessible due to their space or time extents or both computer simulations serve as an essential tool for studying interactions in coupled geologic systems yet numerical models have traditionally treated the earth s surface and its interior as independent domains none of the widely used open source software packages for simulating mantle convection long term tectonics or short term tectonics have incorporated surface processes until very recently similarly software for the simulation of surface processes has generally been driven by prescribing vertical uplift rates even though it is clear that these uplift rates depend on and thus must be coupled to erosion rates this project couples two widely used community codes i aspect a package originally intended for the simulation of mantle dynamics but more recently also used extensively for modeling of long term processes in tectonic plates with active development towards incorporating physics such as compressible elasticity necessary to capture shorter term processes and ii landlab an environment that includes and facilitates the description of surface processes since their inception these codes have transformed the level of complexity of simulations in their respective domains and have gained large user bases both codes are backed by large nsf funded centers the computational infrastructure for geodynamics cig in the case of aspect and the community surface dynamics modeling system csdms in the case of landlab the software and workflows developed through this project enable scientific communities that are typically siloed studying either earth s surface or its interior to initiate new studies of coupled processes with direct societal relevance including geohazards and resource exploration model use cases implemented by the project demonstrate the coupling on different spatial and temporal scales which can be used by domain scientists to initiate independent research projects project training materials are incorporated into long standing training programs associated with aspect e g annual hackathons and landlab e g csdms

this award supports theoretical research studying exotic collective behaviors involving many quantum particles at absolute zero temperature such systems can organize into myriad quantum states of matter quantum phases depending on details of interactions between particles while the most common of such phases and their transformations are well understood some quantum phase transitions do not fit into conventional paradigms most notably continuous transitions between phases with mismatched orders as can occur in quantum magnets yet another class of phases so called gapless spin liquids with emergent itinerant quasiparticles are proposed to occur in several antiferromagnetic solids that defy ordering even at zero temperature here liquid refers to randomness in the directions of the electrons magnetism inside a solid the pi s group will pursue tractable examples of such unusual quantum phase transitions in one and two dimensions and also questions motivated by recent experiments in candidate spin liquid materials a different aspect of collective quantum behavior is evolution in time when a system of many particles is started in a non equilibrium state with finite energy density above zero temperature this has come to the fore as experimentalists are engineering systems with many degrees of freedom that behave quantum mechanically in part in an effort to develop quantum technologies a fundamental idea to describe such an evolution is that of dynamical thermalization and the closely related eigenstate thermalization hypothesis which offers a way of understanding why time flows only in one direction a notable exception to thermalization so called many body localization occurs in the presence of a large number of impurities a challenging question also of technological interest is whether thermalization can be completely or at least very strongly suppressed in the absence of impurities the pi s group will continue work on understanding pre thermalization phenomena and also on so called quantum many body scar states that violate the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis projects under this award will initiate graduate students to research at the frontier of quantum many particle physics and will teach them a variety of analytical and numerical approaches that will prepare them for future careers in quantum physics and quantum engineering areas technical summary this award supports theoretical research studying different facets of quantum many body physics unconventional quantum phase transitions and critical phases at zero temperature and unusual thermalization dynamics at non zero energy density above zero temperature while by now we have good fixed point pictures of myriad gapped phases both conventional and exotic we do not have as good an understanding of quantum phase transitions in many cases among these so called deconfined quantum critical points that lie beyond the landau paradigm have fascinated researchers for more than fifteen years however finding truly controlled instances of such critical points has been controversial another challenging open problem is the description of gapless fractionalized phases which are believed to be critical phases that do not require fine tuning the pi s group will search for tractable examples of unconventional quantum critical points in low dimensions and will also pursue projects motivated by recent experiments in candidate gapless spin liquid materials this award will also pursue research in quantum many body dynamics and thermalization in closed quantum systems for many years the interest in such questions had been primarily theoretical as they relate to foundations of statistical mechanics and notions of quantum chaos however modern experiments in engineered quantum systems such as cold atom arrays trapped ions dipolar spin impurities etc have already achieved well isolated systems with many quantum degrees of freedom and are already finding unexpected phenomena opening new exciting directions in the field in this context the pi s group will specifically pursue examples of unusual thermalization in systems without disorder and will explore questions of pre thermalization and quantum many body scar states the pi s group studies concrete systems to address challenging open questions and combines and develops both analytical and numerical tools to achieve this projects under this award will initiate graduate students to research at the frontier of condensed matter physics the students will learn a variety of analytical and

is the second most abundant element in the earth s crust and the reactions that it undergoes on the surface of our planet controls the biogeochemical cycles of many elements including carbon most minerals in the earth s crust are composed of silicate minerals and the dissolution or weathering of these minerals on land can be driven by carbonic acid which forms by carbon dioxide and reacting with water the drawdown of atmospheric co a greenhouse gas via these forward weathering reactions can modulate the c cycle and regulate the temperature of the surface of our planet at the same time clays and silicate minerals can form in the ocean seabed reverse weathering mostly in tropical deltas and these reactions produce carbon dioxide the magnitude of both forward and reverse weathering reactions can be traced through the ratios of si isotopes and the ratios of an associated product of si mineral weathering lithium over different time scales provided we can differentiate the signatures of these distinct reactions this project will study reverse weathering signatures within major sediment depocenters that can impact c cycling and the coupled cycles of si and li it seeks to develop si and li isotope ratios in different biogeochemical reservoirs as proxies of modern reverse weathering reactions further the project aims to develop models that provide a basis for reconstructing ancient c and coupled elemental cycling in the ocean measurements and model simulations are an important perspective from which to view modern changes and rates of change in the c cycle anthropogenic forcing of the c cycle is driving rapid changes in climate and ocean chemistry for example acidification these changes and impacts are of major societal importance in this regard it is critical to check the dynamics of the c cycle over multiple time scales and understand the processes that control them this project will provide support for two early career scientists two graduate

learning experiences for more than one hundred local th and th grade students through a partnership with the girls at the museum exploring science games program run by the cu museum of natural history stable isotope ratios of li and si in marine geological records are promising proxies of the many mechanisms through which the si and c cycle are coupled on the surface earth advances in instrumentation and technological innovation over the past years have allowed us to resolve isotope ratios of silicate mineral weathering products li and si with enough precision to render their

are in isotopic mass balance the model will be calibrated against available si isotopic compositions in geological records of biogenic si through the last glacial maximum a new inverse isotope mass balance model will be constructed for modern li marine summaries a promising proxy for the abiological si cycle and also tested modeling results will allow us to probe the nuances of co control by the

45269,2054356,University Corporation For Atmospheric Res,CO,2021-08-01,2026-07-31,exploring the tropical atmosphere with advanced radio occultation processing serving and analyzing radio occultation data to advance atmospheric science,the global navigation satellite system gnss is the set of satellite constellations launched worldwide to provide positioning information for all forms of navigation the system includes the galileo constellation launched by the european union the glonass satellites from russia beidou from china and the us global positioning system gps gps is well known in the us as we rely on it for driving directions and an ever expanding array of cell phone apps but the radio waves transmitted for gnss positioning also have tremendous value for looking at the atmosphere gnss radio waves are refracted by the atmosphere to an extent which depends on the temperature and water vapor content of the lower atmosphere and the density of electric charge in the ionosphere the refraction causes a delay in the phase of the waves when they reach a receiver and if the reciever is placed on an orbiting satellite the phase delay can be used to measure ionospheric charge and atmospheric temperature and water vapor although water vapor requires additional information because the measurements are made during the rising and setting or occultation of a gnss transmitter satellite relative to a receiver satellite the technology is referred to as gnss radio occultation gnssro gnssro has proven to be a highly effective observing method as the measurements can be made under all weather conditions are unaffected by clouds and aerosols and are absolutely calibrated si traceable through the atomic clocks that support the gnss transmitters they also have relatively high vertical resolution providing a profile of atmospheric properties which can be used to identify sharp features such as the tropopause and fluctuations in temperature caused by atmospheric gravity waves this award supports work on the development and scientific use of gnssrso measurements at the university corporation for atmospheric research ucar ucar has played a foundational role in gnssro technology starting with the gps met proof of concept satellite mission in the s and they led the development of the constellation observing system for meteorology the ionosphere and climate cosmic also called cosmic or c a constellation of six gnssro receiver satellites launched in they also managed the development of cosmic c a mission led by the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration a follow on constellation of six satellites orbiting over the tropics and subtropics degrees south to north launched in the ucar group formally known as the ucar cosmic program has also been collecting and processing gnssro data from several other satellite missions for example sac c from argentina grace a nasa mission metop a and b eumetsat missions and paz from spain including all satellite misions there are now two decades of continuous gnssro observations a long enough record to be valuable for research on climate trends work here emphasizes the low latitudes motivated by the high density and quality of low latitude observations available from c one question to be addressed is the extent to which ro based observations can lead to better understanding of hurricanes and other tropical cyclones tcs for instance the extent to which accumulation of water vapor in a deep layer near the developing tc promotes storm development another is whether the discrepancy between the observed profile of tropical tropospheric warming and the profile simulated in response to greenhouse gas increases is due to inadequacies of climate models or biases in observations the high resolution and absolute calibration of ro soundings makes them ideal address this question other issues to be pursued include better characterization of the tropical waves which drive the stratospheric quasi biennial oscillation and the use of ro to assess the representation of water vapor in commonly used reanalysis datasets the project also includes research on the low latitude ionosphere taking advantage of the ion velocity meter ivm deployed as a secondary payload on the c satellites as well as two recently launched nasa missions the global scale observations of the limb and disk gold and ionospheric connection explorer icon the suite of c icon and gold observations is used to study equatorial plasma bubbles and the effect of the equatorial dynamo on the ionosphere further work seeks to improve the assimilation of gnssro observations into ionospheric models in addition to these research applications the project includes research to advance gnssro theory and algorithms so as to maximize the value of ro for atmospheric research one concern is the effects of random refractivity fluctuations on ro measurements as such fluctuations are thought to contribute to the negative bias in ro derived atmospheric moisture commonly found near the surface a further concern is the detection of super refraction in which refraction becomes strong enough to trap gnss radio waves near the surface and prevent their use for determining temperature and water vapor super refraction must be detected so that data from the ducted portion of the ro profiles is not used additional work develops ro methods for the ionosphere including better methods for detecting localized charge irregularities and ray tracing techniques which use separate ray paths for the two wavelengths transmitted by gnss satellites the work has societal as well as scientific value due to the use of gnssro for weather prediction and climate monitoring gnssro is used in most weather forecasting centers and improvements in ro algorithms developed under this award have direct application in weather prediction the examination of gnssro as an observational technique for looking at hurricanes is particularly relevant given the lack of observations that can be used to initialize hurricane forecasts the ionospheric work is also directly applicable to efforts to predict space weather in the area of climate monitoring the project develops datasets from ro observations over multiple satellite missions processed in a consistent manner so that they can be used to assess long term trends in temperature and moisture the award includes support for hosting archiving serving and supporting access to datasets by the research community the datasets and data services are augmented by several education and outreach efforts seeking to facilitate use of gnss ro data by the research community one of these is a postdoctoral research program which supports early career scientists seeking to work with ro observations the project also works with the ucar significant opportunities in atmospheric research and science soars program through which it provides mentorship to students from underrepresented groups a two week summer colloquium is planned for to bring together experts in gnssro and give early career researchers an opportunity to become familiar with gnssro

25697,2246686,University of Hawaii,HI,2023-07-01,2026-06-30,collaborative research experimental and computational constraints on the isotope fractionation of mossbauer inactive elements in mantle minerals,isotope compositions of deep earth minerals provide crucial constraints on the earth s internal structure and chemical evolution the isotope compositions of deep earth minerals are controlled by a process named isotope fractionation in which different isotopes redistribute between different minerals under various pressures and temperatures there are three conventional ways to constrain equilibrium isotope fractionation in deep earth minerals namely theoretical calculation mass spectroscopy and nuclear resonance scattering however each method has its own challenges theoretical calculation is limited by physical approximations used in the model and has to be benchmarked by experiments mass spectroscopy has difficulty in determining the attainment of equilibrium and is time consuming and nuclear resonance scattering can only be applied to the few m ssbauer active elements this proposal describes a novel multidisciplinary study on the isotope fractionations of deep earth minerals that are difficult to be constrained by conventional experimental approaches through collaborative and synergetic efforts by combining state of the art x ray spectroscopy with theoretical calculations the researcher s approach is experimentally benchmarked time efficient directly reflects the equilibrium isotope fractionation and can be applied to nearly all elements they aim to answer the following questions with their proposed study how do the m ssbauer inactive elements in deep earth minerals redistribute with pressure temperature and crystal structure how to constrain the fractionation of m ssbauer inactive elements in deep earth solid solutions efficiently and how does vibrational anharmonicity affect the isotope fractionation in mantle silicates the project will support three early to mid career researchers to continue their research at the university of hawaii at maona zhang and b chen and purdue university m chen through this project the team will develop both experimental instruments at a national user facility and open source codes for computation and the research suite will be available to domestic and international researchers in earth sciences and beyond undergraduate assistants and postdoc scholars will be involved in this project this project is also committed to establishing the career development pathways for the involved early career researchers pushing for the gender and racial equality in geoscience and broadening the participation in stem of traditionally underrepresented minorities the fractionation of the isotopes of constituent elements of mantle minerals at high p t conditions are considered the ramifications of the differentiation of the earth offering crucial clues for the mantle s composition and chemical evolution previous studies on the isotope fractionation of m ssbauer inactive elements between minerals were either measured using mass spectroscopy in which the attainment of equilibrium requires additional caution or estimated from theoretical calculations without corroboration from experiments the researchers have demonstrated that the reduced partition function ratio factor of tetracoordinated si can be constrained by theoretical calculation calibrated in situ high t sxd experiments in this proposed project they will extend the method to determine experimentally constrained factors of hexacoordinated si in non quenchable deep earth minerals for the first time they will also tackle challenges to establish an efficient approach to determine factors in solid solutions by theoretical calculations which are to be benchmarked by sxd experiments and thus allows them to investigate the isotope fractionation of hexacoordinated ti in deep earth minerals their proposed combined approach circumvents direct theoretical modeling of solid solutions which significantly reduces computational costs using the combined approaches of experiments and theoretical modeling the correction to si factor in hydrous phyllosilicates induced by the vibrational anharmonicity will be investigated the proposed experimentally benchmarked machine learning framework to establish a highly accurate yet efficient model will allow them to provide reliable estimations of si factor in anharmonic mineral systems though they only propose to study select m ssbauer inactive elements si ti in this proposal the same approach can be extended to other elements such as c o mg and ca all the three proposed tasks will build the foundation for a complete landscape of isotope distribution in

41717,2114071,Mississippi State University,MS,2021-09-01,2026-08-31,collaborative research testing hypotheses about rates of diversification controls on diversification related to the opportunities for speciation vs fate of incipient divergences,all of combined planetary biodiversity owes its existence to the formation of new species it is the newly formed boundaries separating one group of individuals from others that maintain the distinct and unique characteristics of individuals in each species new species can form quickly or slowly depending upon this pace of species formation i e the rate of diversification the numbers of species within a group will differ however the diversification rate itself is not sufficient to understand why species diversity varies because there are multiple potential explanations for any estimated diversification rate this research project will focus on statistically distinguishing among these different explanations in order to understand why species diversity differs across space time and among different groups of organisms specifically by applying newly developed statistical models of species formation to genomic sequences from individuals collected across multiple populations within each of several hundred species the research will distinguish between various potential controls on diversification these alternative controls have never previously been tested within a single study as such the research will provide unprecedented insights into how the frequency of formation and persistence of isolated populations and hence the opportunities for new species to form affects diversification rates the targeted study group north american melanoplinae grasshoppers includes representatives that span the climatic geographic and ecological conditions theorized to affect species formation which will provide robust tests of how biodiversity is shaped by illustrating the utility of population level sampling within species in tests of species formation the project will set a new benchmark for other researchers to consider for their own biodiversity studies such research is important to avoid misinterpretations about why biodiversity differs across geographic regions or among habitats or among groups of organisms that co occur the research will also highlight the importance of museum collections for genomic era biodiversity studies while enhancing this publicly accessible community resource through the addition of newly collected and curated specimens including their dna ecological and geographic information a complementary program of public and educational outreach activities built around the core research objective of why diversification might be promoted or inhibited across different landscapes or organismal groups will reach a diverse audience diversity differences observed across taxonomic groups reflect different rates of diversification however there are two fundamentally different controls on diversification dynamics meaning there are different explanations for any given diversification rate the evolution of reproductive isolation that affects the fate of incipient divergences versus the frequency with which isolated populations form and persist affecting the opportunities for speciation because diversification studies are typically carried out on phylogenetic estimates of species lineages it has not been possible to test hypotheses about the opportunities for speciation this research addresses this knowledge gap through combined theoretical and empirical studies and the generation of large scale genomic data the research will apply newly developed analytical methods to test hypotheses about diversification rates based on phylogenetic estimates of species lineages vs the controls on diversification dynamics based on phylogenetic estimates of species and population lineages by testing for linkages between different controls on diversification dynamics with factors potentially affecting the formation of new species e g fragmented habitats topographically complex landscapes or periods of climatic change and species specific traits the work will address why these conditions might promote or inhibit the formation of new species this will be the first study to establish potential linkages between the various controls on diversity dynamics e g topographic complexity geologic and climatic events and selectively driven divergence leveraging the researchers extensive specimen collections with advances in collecting large scale genomic data across hundreds of thousands of individuals and state of the art analytics the empirical dataset will contain almost complete taxonomic coverage of over closely related grasshopper species of which are from a single genus that radiated recently i e within the pleistocene and pliocene in north america and mexico by combining the skillsets of researchers with taxonomic expertise and genomic and quantitative analytics the research team will promote broad training and mentoring of graduate students while also offering public and educational outreach activities developed by researchers with different

summary this award supports openkim a cyberinfrastructure component of the research community that uses computer simulations of atoms based on newton s laws and models for the interaction between atoms to attack problems in materials science engineering and physics and to enable the discovery of new materials design new devices to advance the understanding of materials related phenomena and much more recent years have seen significant advancement in the areas of materials knowledge discovery and manufacturing methodologies this includes for example the development of graphene a single atomic layer of carbon atoms which has exceptional mechanical thermal and electrical properties and the related class of two dimensional materials with unprecedented material properties now being extensively studied by scientists and engineers another example is the advent of three dimensional printing techniques that allow engineers to design new materials from the ground up that can be tailor made for their specific application computer simulation of materials at the atomic scale is one of the key enabling technologies driving the current materials revolution although the most accurate atomic scale simulations employ the equations of quantum mechanics such computations take so long to complete even on today s powerful computers that practically they are limited to a few thousands of atoms this is simply not enough for the study of materials properties which requires the simulation of interactions between millions and even billions of atoms thus materials researchers rely on faster more approximate equations known as interatomic models ims to describe atomic interactions these models are fast but typically they are only accurate for a restricted range of material properties this limited range of applicability necessitates the creation of many ims even for a single material such as silicon organizing sharing and evaluating the range of applicability of these ims has been a long standing challenge for the materials research community in most cases researchers have no way of knowing which im is suitable for their particular application further the proliferation of ims often designed to work only with specific simulation programs makes it difficult to share and exchange ims and to reproduce other researchers work which is how science evolves and self corrects the knowledgebase of interatomic models kim is a project that is working to solve these challenges to date the kim project has developed an online framework at https openkim org to address the issues of im provenance selection and portability ims archived on this website are exhaustively tested and can be used in plug and play fashion in a variety of major simulation codes that conform to a standard developed as part of the kim project the development activity of the current project will extend the kim framework by broadening the number and types of supported ims and will add new capabilities and educational resources that will make it easy for researchers to integrate the ims and materials data available on openkim org into their daily research workflow further emerging techniques in information topology and machine learning will be applied to study and quantify the inherent uncertainty in predictions made by ims and to assist materials researchers to select the best im for their application together the development educational and research activities of this project are expected to significantly increase the userbase and broader impact of the kim project technical summary this award supports openkim a community knowledgebase of interatomic models kim for simulation kim is a project for normalizing the use of ims in molecular simulations of materials an im often referred to as a potential or force field is an approximate method for computing the energy and its derivatives for an atomic configuration this project addresses both traditional physics based ims and the new class of data driven ims introduced in recent years in a sustained effort the kim project has developed a systematic framework to address the im provenance selection and portability problems faced by materials researchers before kim these challenges were the cause of significant inefficiencies and inaccuracies in the research pipeline today an im available on openkim org is subjected to a rigorous set of verification checks that aim to ensure that its implementation conforms to a high software engineering standard and to an extensive set of tests each of which computes a well defined material property for assessing the im s accuracy a researcher can come to openkim org and explore the predictions of kim models in comparison with experimental or quantum reference data to select a suitable im for their application the current project is aimed at extending kim to become an integral component of the workflow of researchers engaged in molecular simulation to make their work more efficient and their results more reliable and reproducible to achieve this vision the principal investigators pis will pursue the following program of cyberinfrastructure r d and basic research related to im usage and science the cyberinfrastructure r d will include extensions to kim standards to support additional common im features such as long range fields and added support for ims having cutting edge features that cannot yet be standardized further kim will be integrated into existing simulation tools so that researchers may query and retrieve data archived on openkim org as part of their daily workflow this approach reduces errors ensures reproducibility uses a standard tested method embodied in a kim test to obtain the desired property and firmly integrates the kim framework into the workflow of computational materials researchers the basic research component of the project includes three research thrusts requiring advances to enhance the reliability of molecular simulations im uncertainty the pis will use ideas from information topology and differential geometry to automatically generate im ensembles for obtaining estimates of the inherent uncertainty of the im im transferability the pis plan to adapt a multi task machine learning approach to predict an im s accuracy for different applications this will lead to a rigorous objective criterion to assist researchers with im selection im heuristics by mining im predictions and reference data archived on openkim org it is possible to identify correlations similar to empirical heuristics such as vegard s rule and connections between microscopic properties and macroscopic features detection of such heuristics will provide insights into the limitations of ims help design optimal training sets and lead to better understanding of the properties of ims generally in terms of broader impacts the scope of the kim project is unusually large far beyond materials science due to the prevalence of molecular simulations across the physical sciences from microbiology to geology the project aims to maximize its impact by expanding the kim user base engaging the

12759,2343864,California Institute of Technology,CA,2024-09-01,2027-08-31,collaborative research bridging short and long time scales in global plate tectonics through solver adaptivity,the underlying geophysical connections linking great earthquakes with plate tectonics will be addressed using sophisticated models these seismic events are the largest earthquakes with magnitudes of nine or higher and are among largest sources of natural hazard affecting many countries including the united states scientists have long known that these earthquakes are linked to plate tectonics and occur where an oceanic plate dives into the earth s interior at a subduction zone like the one along the coasts of washington state oregon and northern california unfortunately fundamental issues remain as to the reasons where and when they occur this interdisciplinary team will link the long term physics driving and resisting plate tectonics with that of great earthquakes the outcome of the models will be a deeper understanding of earthquake occurrence currently the ability to solve the set of equations describing the physics of this coupled problem is beyond the ability of mathematical methods consequently this project brings together mathematical scientists with earth scientists to attempt to solve this problem collaboratively mathematically problems like this are solved on the largest supercomputers and are described by many equations for the plate tectonics problem by itself the equations change only a small amount from one moment of time to the next in the computer model but in this coupled problem only a set of the equations change when an earthquake happens and so the mathematicians will discover and implement new ways to solve such large sets of equations meanwhile the earth scientists will use the new methods to understand the basic physics of the coupled earthquake and plate tectonics problem ultimately tailoring the methods to models of individual plates and faults such as the juan de fuca plate which subducts below the pacific northwest the algorithms are expected to efficiently use the largest supercomputers now in the planning stage including the nsf planned lccf leadership class computing facility moreover the computer software called rhea will be distributed open source and will be well engineered and documented the team will collaborate with the computational infrastructure for geodynamics supported by the nsf for the distribution of rhea to the broader scientific community the pis will train graduate students at caltech virginia tech and nyu at the boundary between the mathematical sciences and science applications the team will participate in outreach programs in california through a program that brings geophysical science to local title i schools in virginia through one that provides outreach projects for local high schools and in new york city through a program that focuses on exposing undergraduates to mathematical research the forces controlling plate tectonics and the conditions leading to great earthquakes are currently treated as separate fundamental problems but in this project they will be linked with a focused effort to develop and apply a new generation of finite element methods with solver adaptivity that will scale on the largest computers the activity will involve major advances in mathematical and computational algorithms for multi physics problems the team will bridge the space time divide and self consistently compute the long term motions of tectonic plates and the intervening space time evolution of stress within and adjacent to plate boundaries this undertaking is beyond currently available methods and mathematically requires new concepts to allow tracking the shifting but localized regions of enormous computational need during earthquakes the team will expand the notion of space and time discretization adaptivity towards solver adaptivity solver adaptivity will use equation residuals to focus computing resources towards the most efficient solution of large linear and nonlinear systems of equations since the system arising by discretizing the equations in the earthquake plate tectonic problem typically has tens and hundreds of millions of unknowns solvers based on matrix factorization are out of question and one must rely on iterative solvers that also allow parallelization the algorithms are expected to scale on the largest anticipated supercomputers with distributed memory and computational elements such as the nsf planned lccf leadership class computing facility as such the scalable algorithms will fill an important need and demonstrate the efficient use of future lccf machines the methods will be incorporated into the highly scalable stokes solver finite element package rhea visco elasticity and frictional material models will be implemented into rhea the science and mathematical challenges will be addressed with an interdisciplinary team consisting of a geophysicist who works on the dynamics of plate tectonics a mechanician who works on the physics of earthquakes and applied mathematicians who work on linear and nonlinear scalable pde solvers the team will apply the methods to understand the coupled physics generically first in two dimensions and then in three dimensions then using models regionally tailored by the explicit incorporation of seismic geologic and fault structure they will simulate cascadia and the northwestern pacific subduction systems this project is jointly supported by the computational and data enabled science and engineering in mathematical and statistical sciences program in the division of mathematical sciences and the geophysics program in the division of earth sciences this

understanding in the primate brain,the last ten years have witnessed an astonishing revolution in ai with deep neural networks suddenly approaching human level performance on problems like recognizing objects in an image and words in an audio recording but impressive as these feats are they fall far short of human like intelligence the critical gap between current ai and human intelligence is that beyond just classifying patterns of input humans build mental models of the world this project begins with the problem of physical scene understanding how one extracts not just the identities and locations of objects in the visual world but also the physical properties of those objects their positions and velocities their relationships to each other the forces acting upon them and the effects of forces that could be exerted on them it is hypothesized that humans represent this information in a structured mental model of the physical world and use that model to predict what will happen next much as the physics engine in a video game generates physically plausible future states of virtual worlds to test this idea computational models of physical scene understanding will be built and tested for their ability to predict future states of the physical world in a variety of scenarios performance of these models will then be compared to humans and to more traditional deep network models both in terms of their accuracy on each task and their patterns of errors computational models that incorporate structured representations of the physical world will then be tested against standard convolutional neural networks in their ability to explain neural responses of the human brain using fmri and the monkey brain using direct neural recording these computational models will provide the first explicit theories of how physical scene understanding might work in the human brain at the same time advancing the ability of ai systems to solve the same problems because the ability to understand and predict the physical world is essential for planning any action this work is expected to help advance many technologies that require such planning from robotics to self driving cars to brain machine interfaces each of the participating labs will also expand their established track records of recruiting training and mentoring women and under represented minorities at the undergraduate graduate and postdoctoral levels finally the collaborating laboratories will continue and increase their involvement in the dissemination of science to the general public via public talks web sites and outreach activities deep neural networks have revolutionized object recognition in computers as well as understanding of object recognition in the primate brain but object recognition is just one aspect of vision and the ventral stream is just one of many brain systems studying physical scene understanding is a step toward scaling this reverse engineering approach up to the rest of the mind and brain predicting what will happen next and planning effective action requires understanding the physical basis and physical relationships in the visual world yet it is unknown how humans do this or how machines could both challenges are addressed in this project by the building of image computable neurally mappable computational models of physical scene understanding and prediction thread i and using these models as explicit hypotheses for how the brain might accomplish these tasks which will then be tested with behavioral and neural data from humans thread ii and non human primates thread iii this project aims to make a transformative leap in understanding from small scale special case models and isolated experimental tests to an integrated large scale general purpose model of a major swathe of the primate brain that functionally explains much of the immediate content of our perceptual experience in every scene that confronts us the work will advance theory by developing the first image computable models capable of human level physical scene understanding and prediction beyond understanding of the mind and brain this research is directly relevant to ai and robotics which require physical scene understanding and brain machine interfaces which require understanding of the relevant neural codes for the broader research community the project will a develop public datasets benchmark tasks and challenges b host adversarial collaborations to address these challenges and c host interdisciplinary workshops linking research communities from psychology to ai to neuroscience to address the fundamental questions that span these fields this award reflects nsf s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
